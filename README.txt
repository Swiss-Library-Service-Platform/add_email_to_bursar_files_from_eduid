HOW TO USE IT
-------------
- Close Excel (to avoid conflicts with the script)
- Get an Alma Users API key with read rights
- Open the script "add_email_from_eduid.ps1" for edition
- Add the key in this file below "$API_KEY" in "Variables to be edited by the user" section
- Add the absolute path to the file to modify (somthing that should normally beginn with "C:\...")
- Save and run the script with Powershell

RESULT
------
The script creates a new file with the email of the users as the last column. The file
will be suffixed with "_processed.xlsx"

Note: if the script stops for any reason without finishing the process, it is possible to
restart it at any row. You have only to indicate the row number in the "$START_ON_ROW"
variable (see "Variables to be edited by the user" section)
